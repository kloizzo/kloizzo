# Howdy, Friend! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m **Kayla**, a dedicated full-stack web developer with a passion for building clean, maintainable, and user-focused applications. After four years as an educator, I transitioned into software development and haven't looked back since. I traded in my days of rangling children for rangling bugs instead. It wasn't for nothing though, throughout my work I often make use of my ability to break down complex concepts and communicate effectively to craft elegant solutions in code.
